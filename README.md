# WISHBOURNE
Make a wish from a celebrity by creating a crowdfunding campaign.

## Project Details
Our project aims to establish a decentralized platform on the Solana Blockchain where users can propose tasks or requests for celebrities and content creators through crowdfunding topics. Each topic can be supported with a donation of 1 USDC. When a task is completed, the content creator receives the pooled funds. Our fullstack app will facilitate this process, enabling users to create, view, and contribute to crowdfunding topics seamlessly. By leveraging blockchain technology, we ensure transparency, security, and efficiency in the crowdfunding process. This project empowers users to engage directly with their favorite influencers while providing content creators with a fair and decentralized way to monetize their work.

Our vision is to revolutionize interaction with content creators by introducing a novel crowdfunding platform on the Solana Blockchain. This project redefines the way people engage with their favorite influencers, offering a direct channel to propose tasks or wishes while supporting creators financially. By democratizing the process, we empower users globally to shape content creation and foster deeper connections with their idols. Through transparency and decentralization, we aim to foster a community where creativity thrives, inspiring meaningful collaborations and unleashing a wave of innovative content. Together, we're transforming the landscape of online interaction, making wishes a reality for both creators and their audience.
